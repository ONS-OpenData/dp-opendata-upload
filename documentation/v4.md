# V4

**Short Summary**

“V4” is the name given to the format of the tidy data that CMD (customise my data) accepts.  A V4 file consists of three type of columns 
- One observation column 
- Any number of attribute columns
- At least two dimension column pairs (which come in key-value-pairs)

An example of a v4 file would look like this: ![v4](https://github.com/ONS-OpenData/dp-opendata-upload/blob/main/documentation/v4_example.png)

This example has an observation column, no attribute columns and three dimensions (in six key-value columns)

**Columns**

As mentioned above the V4 file consists of three type of columns. 

*Observation*

This column is always the first column and is labelled `v4_x` (where x is the number of attribute columns). Values in this column must always be a number or empty.

*Attributes*

These columns come immediately after the observation column and the number of attribute columns is given by `x` in `v4_x`. There are no rules regarding the labelling of these columns (apart from normal practices).
One of the common columns used here is a `Data Marking` column. Used when an observation is suppressed (or doesn’t exist) for example.
It is also completely fine (and common) for no attribute columns to exist in a V4 file which would result in the observation column being labelled `v4_0`

*Dimensions*

These come immediately after the attribute columns (observation column if no attribute columns exist) and are defined by a code list. Each dimension is represented by two columns, the first representing the “ID” for each value and the second representing the corresponding label for that “ID”. 

For example, the geography code for the UK is `K02000001` so this would come in the first column and the label corresponding to this code, `United Kingdom`, would come in the second column.

The labels for these columns must match the dataset recipe, which in turn must match the ID and label for that code list (which is already loaded into the database). 

For example, the `uk-only` code list has a code list ID of `uk-only` and a label of `Geography` therefore the first column for this dimension would be labelled `uk-only` and the second would be `Geography`.

CMD is coded to only accept the time dimension as the first dimension and the geography dimension as the second. Which means that a v4 must, as a minimum, have a time and a geography dimension. The time dimension must come immediately after the attribute column(s) (observation if no attribute columns exist) and the geography dimension must come next after the time dimension. After this the order does not matter, as long as each dimension comes in key value pairs (with the ID always coming first).

**Further**

There is no limit on the number of observations (rows of data) for the V4 file. The only constraint is that the V4 file must contain no ‘sparsity’. Sparsity should be taken care of during the transform process. In short, a V4 contains sparsity if all combinations of choices for each dimension are not represented by a row of data within the V4. If a V4 containing sparsity is uploaded into CMD, the upload will fail.
